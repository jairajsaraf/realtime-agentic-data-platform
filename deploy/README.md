# Deploy assets — single-host topology

Local, additive deploy assets for running the existing `rtdp` surfaces from one Docker image on
a single host. **Nothing here provisions cloud resources or contains real secrets.**

- `Dockerfile` (repo root) — one image; entrypoint is the `rtdp` CLI.
- `docker-compose.yml` — `api` (read API, always on) + `stream` (micro-batch writer, **opt-in via the
  `ingestion` profile**), a one-shot `maintain` profile, an `s3` profile (MinIO object storage), an
  `edge` profile (Caddy reverse proxy + HTTPS), and an `observability` profile (Datadog Agent OTLP
  intake).
- `Caddyfile` — Caddy site config; reverse-proxies the public hostname to the `api` service.
- `bootstrap_host.sh` — idempotent host prep (Docker, deploy user, UFW). Run once on a new host.
- `host_deploy.sh` — the host-side deploy action (compose pull + up + `/livez` liveness check) the
  gated CI deploy job invokes over SSH.
- `.env.example` — placeholder environment; copy to a local, gitignored `.env` or inject via a
  secrets manager. Never commit a real `.env`.

## File:// backend (default — runnable with no secrets)

```
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d --build                       # api only (no writer)
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --profile ingestion up -d --build   # api + stream writer
```

The `stream` writer is **opt-in behind the `ingestion` profile**, so a bare `up -d` (and `make
compose-up`) starts only `api`. `api` and `stream` share one volume; the SQLite catalog and warehouse
live on it. The API is on `http://localhost:8000` (`/docs`, `/health`). Until data exists `/health`
returns 503 — bring up the `ingestion` profile, or seed once with
`docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml run --rm api ingest --rows 50`, so the first batch creates
the table and `/health` returns 200. The Docker healthcheck and the deploy probe use **`/livez`**
(liveness — 200 whenever the API process serves, no data required), so a fresh host becomes healthy and
deploys **without** starting ingestion; **`/health`** stays the readiness check (503 until the table
loads) that Datadog's `http_check` polls.

## S3-compatible backend (self-hosted MinIO via the `aws` backend)

The `rtdp` `aws` backend honors `RTDP_S3_ENDPOINT_URL` when it is explicitly set, so it can target
MinIO without any LocalStack involvement (real AWS remains the default when no endpoint is set).

1. Provide config/secrets (see `.env.example`). Set `RTDP_STORAGE_BACKEND=aws`, point
   `RTDP_S3_ENDPOINT_URL` at the MinIO service, and set `RTDP_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` /
   `RTDP_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` equal to the MinIO root credentials.
2. Bring up the `s3` profile (MinIO + a one-shot `minio-init` that creates the bucket):

   ```
   docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --profile s3 up -d --build
   ```

The MinIO **console is bound to `127.0.0.1:9001` (private/local-only)**; the S3 API (`:9000`) is
internal to the compose network only. The catalog stays local SQLite on the shared volume in all
backends (single-writer; keep one `stream` replica and schedule `maintain` not to overlap it).

### MinIO object-data location (`RTDP_MINIO_DATA_PATH`)

`RTDP_MINIO_DATA_PATH` is a **Compose/deployment-only** variable — **not** an `rtdp` application
`Settings` field / `RTDP_*` app setting. It selects the source of MinIO's `/data` mount:

- **Unset or empty** → the Docker **named volume `minio-data`** (the local/CI default). The Compose
  expression `${RTDP_MINIO_DATA_PATH:-minio-data}` falls back to `minio-data` when the variable is
  unset **or** empty.
- **An absolute host path** (production) → a **bind mount** onto that path, e.g. a dedicated block
  volume. The host filesystem must already be **mounted persistently**, and the destination directory
  must **exist with permissions the MinIO container can write**, before deploy.

**Render and inspect the effective mount before deploying** — check the `minio` service's `volumes:`
in the rendered model for both modes:

```
# Default — expect  source: minio-data   type: volume
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --profile s3 config

# Absolute path — expect  source: /mnt/minio-data/minio   type: bind
RTDP_MINIO_DATA_PATH=/mnt/minio-data/minio \
  docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --profile s3 config
```

`/mnt/minio-data/minio` is a **generic example**; use your host's real block-volume path only in the
host's secret store (Doppler), never in the repo. When you switch to a bind mount, the old
`minio-data` named volume is left in place as **rollback protection — do not delete it during a
migration** (reclaiming its space is a separate, later step). Object-store capacity is **not** a
substitute for retention, snapshot expiration, orphan-file cleanup, compaction, monitoring, or
backups — those remain **follow-up** work, out of scope here.

### Ingestion writer (opt-in via the `ingestion` profile)

The `stream` micro-batch writer is gated behind the **`ingestion`** Compose profile — a service with
no profile is always started, so `stream` (like `maintain`) now starts **only** when its profile is
active:

- A **bare** `docker compose up -d` (and `make compose-up`) starts only `api`. The host deploy runs
  `COMPOSE_PROFILES=s3,edge,observability`, which **does not include `ingestion`, so the deploy will
  not select `stream`** — it stays stopped until you add `ingestion`.
- **Caveat:** explicitly targeting the service (`docker compose … up -d stream`) or adding `ingestion`
  to `COMPOSE_PROFILES` **can still start it** — the profile prevents *accidental* startup, not
  deliberate startup.
- To run the writer locally or resume ingestion on the host, add the profile:
  `docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --profile ingestion up -d` (or set
  `COMPOSE_PROFILES=…,ingestion`).

## Edge / TLS (profile `edge`)

Caddy terminates TLS and reverse-proxies the public hostname to the `api` service:

```
RTDP_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=demo.example.me docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --profile edge up -d
```

- **Local:** `RTDP_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME` defaults to `localhost`; Caddy uses its internal CA, so test with
  `curl -k https://localhost/health` (or hit the API directly on `http://localhost:8000/health`).
- **Public host:** set `RTDP_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME` to the real domain (DNS A-record → host, ports 80/443
  open) and Caddy provisions/renews a Let's Encrypt certificate automatically. The Namecheap bundled
  certificate is unused.
- On the public host, set `RTDP_API_BIND=127.0.0.1` so the API's port 8000 is **not** exposed to the
  internet (Docker publishes past UFW, so binding to localhost — not just a firewall rule — is what
  keeps it private). Caddy still reaches the API as `api:8000` on the compose network.

## Observability (profile `observability`)

The OpenTelemetry boundary (`src/rtdp/telemetry.py`) exports traces over **OTLP gRPC**. The
`observability` profile runs a **Datadog Agent** that receives them on `datadog-agent:4317` (internal
compose network only — the port is never published). To enable export on the host:

- run the **deployed image, which includes the optional `[otel]` extra** (CI's `publish-image` builds
  it with `--build-arg RTDP_INSTALL_EXTRAS=otel`);
- set `RTDP_OTEL_ENABLED=true` and `RTDP_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://datadog-agent:4317`;
- supply `DD_API_KEY` (via Doppler) and `DD_SITE` for the Agent;
- set **`DD_HOSTNAME`** to the configured Datadog host label (the deploy uses `rtdp-demo`, which the
  dashboard and monitors scope to via `host:`). A containerized Agent can't reliably derive its host
  name on DigitalOcean (no cloud metadata, no mounted Docker socket), so it must be set or the Agent
  exits.

The Agent also runs an **`http_check`** (`observability/http_check.yaml`, mounted read-only) against
the API's internal `/health`, emitting the `http.can_connect` service check tagged
`instance:rtdp_health` — no new host or public surface.

The Agent **requires `DD_API_KEY` to start**, so the `observability` profile is for the deployed host,
not the default/local path. Telemetry stays **no-op** unless both `RTDP_OTEL_ENABLED=true` and the
`[otel]` extra are present. **`/health` and CI never depend on Datadog**, and there is **no `/metrics`
endpoint**.

Import and validate the dashboard/monitors (`observability/dashboard.json`, `observability/monitors.json`)
against Datadog **US5** per **`observability/README.md`** — reviewable JSON, run by you with your own
keys, never in CI.

## Secrets (Doppler or host env)

All runtime config flows through the existing `RTDP_*` settings. Two equivalent ways to supply it:

- **Doppler (preferred for a deployed host):** `doppler run -- docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --profile s3 up -d`
- **Host env / local `.env`:** `cp deploy/.env.example .env` (kept gitignored), fill in values, then run compose.

**Secret boundary:**

- **GitHub `production` environment secrets** hold **only the SSH deploy credentials**
  (`DEPLOY_SSH_HOST`, `DEPLOY_SSH_USER`, `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY`, `DEPLOY_SSH_PATH`) used by the deploy job.
- **Doppler** (on the host) injects the **app/runtime `RTDP_*`** secrets (plus `DD_API_KEY` and the
  MinIO/AWS credentials) into the containers via `doppler run -- docker compose ...`.

No keys are stored in the repo; CI never receives app runtime secrets.

## Snapshot maintenance

```
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml run --rm maintain
```

One-shot, metadata-only snapshot expiration. On a host, schedule via cron/systemd-timer so it does
not overlap a `stream` commit.

> Note: the droplet, MinIO volume, Doppler/Datadog accounts, and DNS are **provisioned and the demo is
> deployed live** (E6.2–E6.3) — see the "Stage E6 — single-host go-live" and teardown sections of
> `RUNBOOK.md`. These repo files still **contain no real secrets**; runtime config is injected on the
> host (Doppler) and the CI deploy credentials live in the GitHub `production` environment.

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) validates the image and, on `main`, publishes it.
Image validation is kept separate from publishing, and publishing separate from deployment.

- **`docker-smoke`** (every push + PR) — builds the image and runs `scripts/docker_smoke.sh`
  (file:// synthetic seed → `rtdp serve` → `/health` 200) plus a `docker compose config`
  validation. Permissions: `contents: read` only. **Never logs in to or pushes to GHCR; needs no
  secrets** — so pull-request validation requires no cloud credentials.
- **`telemetry-otel`** (every push + PR) — installs the optional `[otel]` extra and runs the
  telemetry suite with coverage so the OpenTelemetry-enabled branches are measured. Permissions:
  `contents: read`; reuses the existing `CODECOV_TOKEN`; the tests never export spans.
- **`publish-image`** (push to `main` only; needs lint/unit + telemetry-otel + LocalStack integration + smoke) —
  builds and pushes `ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>:<sha>` and `:latest` using the built-in
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` (`packages: write`). No external/cloud secret.
- **`deploy`** (push to `main` only; needs lint/unit + LocalStack + smoke + `publish-image`;
  `environment: production`) — a **real, gated SSH deploy**. Raw OpenSSH (no third-party action):
  writes `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` to a 0600 temp file, pins the host key with `ssh-keyscan`, and runs exactly
  one remote command — `bash "$DEPLOY_SSH_PATH/deploy/host_deploy.sh"` (compose pull + up + `/livez`
  liveness check). It passes the approved commit as `RTDP_DEPLOY_EXPECTED_SHA=$GITHUB_SHA`, so the host aborts
  before compose if its checkout is stale (see "Checkout alignment" below). No secrets are printed; it
  runs only after a human approves the `production` environment.

### Required GitHub settings (manual; not automated here)
- Create a **`production` Environment** with **required reviewers** and restrict deployment branches
  to `main`. The deploy job waits for a reviewer's approval before it runs.
- Add the `production` **environment secrets**: `DEPLOY_SSH_HOST`, `DEPLOY_SSH_USER`,
  `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` (the private key), `DEPLOY_SSH_PATH` (the repo/deploy path on the host).
- **Recommended:** also add `DEPLOY_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS` — the host's pinned `known_hosts` entry. When
  set, the deploy verifies the host key against it; otherwise it falls back to in-band `ssh-keyscan`
  (trust-on-first-use) with a warning. Capture/pin it out-of-band in E6.2.
- GHCR packages are **private by default**; make the package public only if the demo image should be
  anonymously pullable (otherwise ensure the host can authenticate to pull it).
- No other repository secrets are required beyond the existing `CODECOV_TOKEN`.

### Manual approval flow
The deploy job is wired but **gated**: on a push to `main` it queues against the `production`
environment and does nothing until a required reviewer approves it in the GitHub UI
(**Actions → the run → Review deployments → Approve**). On approval it SSHes to the host and runs
`host_deploy.sh`; the job **fails if the post-deploy `/livez` liveness check fails**. Nothing deploys
from a PR or a feature branch, and CI provisions no infrastructure.

### Checkout alignment (host must match the approved commit)
`host_deploy.sh` deploys the compose file and mounted config (`docker-compose.yml`,
`observability/http_check.yaml`, `Caddyfile`) **from the host's git checkout** while the image is the
CI-approved SHA-pinned ref — it does **not** `git pull`. To stop an approved image running against a
stale checkout, the gated deploy passes `RTDP_DEPLOY_EXPECTED_SHA=$GITHUB_SHA` and the **CI deploy
wrapper** — the approved stdin script, enforced even if the host's own `host_deploy.sh` is stale —
**aborts before `compose pull/up` unless the host `HEAD` matches the approved commit AND the worktree is
clean** (`git status --porcelain` empty; gitignored files like a host `.env` don't count). `host_deploy.sh`
carries the same guard as defense-in-depth for manual/local runs. Verify-only — the deploy never modifies
the checkout (no-op when the var is unset).

**Advance the host checkout out-of-band before approving/running the gated deploy** — as the `deploy`
user on the host:

```
cd "$DEPLOY_SSH_PATH"            # e.g. /opt/rtdp
git fetch origin main
git checkout <approved-sha>      # or: git pull --ff-only  (if tracking main)
git status --short               # expect clean
```

## Teardown

Full teardown and cost control are documented in `RUNBOOK.md` ("Teardown & cost control"). Two things
to do **first**, before the host goes away: remove the **Live demo** callout from the repo `README.md`
and clear the live URL from the **GitHub About** description, so the docs never advertise an offline
demo. Then destroy the droplet — that, not `docker compose down`, is what stops billing — and revoke
the Doppler host token.
